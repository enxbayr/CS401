The reason:

The "p2" is instance of "Person" and it has only attribute "name". It's equals() uses the "name" for checking equality.
The "p1" is the  instance of "PersonWithJob" and it extended from "Person". Then, the "p1" and "p2" are both have the name and both are a "Person".
That's is why "p2.equals(p1)?" is true.

Then "p1" is not "PersonWithJob" and it is not able to be equalized with "PersonWithJob"'s instance.
